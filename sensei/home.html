    <!-- <div class="reasons">WHY ME</div> -->
    <div class="why why-1">
        <h1>CLIENT INVOLVEMENT</h1>
        <p>The design process is split into steps and milestones where you 
            as my client will give approval of the progress or suggest suitable changes before 
            the design process continues.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="why why-2">
        <h1>PUNCTUALITY</h1>
        <p>I put in effort to ensure the designs are delivered within
            the agreed timeframe. Besides, I set realistic deadlines for myself
            to avoid scenarios where mediocre work is done.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="why why-3">
        <h1>PROFESSIONALISM</h1>
        <p>I leverage all design principles known to me to ensure the 
            final outcome does what it is meant to do. Furthermore, I adhere to legal 
            requirements like copyrights and trademarks when choosing and implementing design tools.
            Finally, I have transparent terms and conditions which reduce chances 
            of conflicts between clients and myself.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="why why-4">
        <h1>MENTORSHIP</h1>
        <p>I have active mentors who I always refer to as well as study their work to 
            ensure my designs reach the required market standard and that my skills 
            are growing in the required pace and order.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="why why-5">
        <h1>NEGOTIABILITY</h1>
        <p>The entire design process from the client reaching out to me,
            to the negotiation of the price and to the delivery of the 
            final design can be worked out to fit your needs as my client.
